# CROssBAR-LLM

This repo is created within the scope of the [CROssBARv2](https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/CROssBARv2) project to convert natural language questions into [Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(query_language)) query language. We leverage LangChain to construct Large Language Model (LLM) chains for the generation of Cypher queries and the subsequent parsing of the resulting output. Streamlit is employed to create an interactive user interface for this process.
